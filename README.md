# Abstract

Has the CoronaVirus pandemic made the people ecologically more aware?
The CoronaVirus pandemic had a huge impact on all our lives. While everyone was isolated at home, it was clear that people started to care more about certain topics such as the well being of their loved ones or ecology. With the closure of most of non-essential industries and factories, the sky and the waters became bluer and the fields more green, and we saw the return of a lot of wild animals that were once kicked out by humans to their natural habitats. Hence, the people started to realize the impact of our way of life on the well-being of our planet. Therefore, it would be very interesting to see if the population became more eco-friendly, either by searching more topics related to the environment or by taking drastic actions on their ways of life like choosing different means of transportations that do not pollute as much as the car or airplane.

# Research Questions
Has the CoronaVirus pandemic made the people ecologically more aware? Did we notice a reduction in the use of means of transportations that are very pollutant such as the car or airplane even after the lockdown? Has the number of searches related to the environment and nature increased during the period of the pandemic? What parts of the world witnessed an increase in ecofriendly awareness?
