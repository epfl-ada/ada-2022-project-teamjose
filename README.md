# Abstract

Has the CoronaVirus pandemic change the way people like to spend their free time?
The CoronaVirus pandemic had a huge impact on all our lives. While everyone was isolated at home, it was clear that people had to change their ways of life as most of our daily outdoor hobbies became forbidden or restricted. Indeed, some public places like gyms or nightclubs had to close their doors and gatherings were extremely limited, making team sports such as football almost impossible to play. Therefore, the people had to find new ways to entertain themselves alone at home such as playing new video games or watching new content on the internet (netflix, twitch ...). Hence it would be interesting to study what entertainment genres had an increase in popularity during the lockdown and if these new found hobbies stayed relevant in the eyes of the people even after the lockdown.

# Research Questions

How did the entertainment means change during the CoronaVirus pandemic lockdown compared to before? Did the genres, consumption levels and nature of entertainment change? Were these changes only valid during the lockdown or did we witness a continuation in the new means of entertainments even after the end of the lockdown?


# Proposed additional datasets

* Google trends
* Wikipedia Api
* Wikidata
* Steam
* Twitch : Top games on Twitch 2016 - 2021, 
  In this dataset we can find the top 200 games on twitch for each month from 2016 to present day.
  The data is divided into two datasets:
    - A bigger file - Twitchgamedata in which we find 200 obeservations per month representing the top games or categories on twitch for that month.
    - A smaller file - Twitchglobaldata in which there is one obeservation per month that contains the general statistics about viewership on twitch.
