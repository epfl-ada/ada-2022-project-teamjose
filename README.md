# Abstract

What cases of mental health issues rose during the Corona Virus pandemic lockdown and what types of entertainments were used to overcome the isolation?
The CoronaVirus pandemic had a huge impact on all our lives. While we were all isolated, some of us had to deal with tough problems such as unemployment, loss of a family member or friend, not being to see their loved ones for a whileâ€¦ that could lead to massive mental health problems like depression or anxiety. Therefore, it would be interesting to analyze the data of the PageViews of certain mental health issues to see what affected the people the most. Moreover, it would be great to inspect the data of certain means of entertainment such as video games and sports to see if there is a correlation between the increase of mental health issues and entertainments to explain a possible getaway from the reality of the pandemic.
