# Abstract

Has the CoronaVirus pandemic change the way people like to spend their free time?
The CoronaVirus pandemic had a huge impact on all our lives. While everyone was isolated at home, it was clear that people had to change their ways of life as most of our daily outdoor hobbies became forbidden or restricted. Indeed, some public places like gyms or nightclubs had to close their doors and gatherings were extremely limited, making team sports such as football almost impossible to play. Therefore, the people had to find new ways to entertain themselves alone at home such as playing new video games or watching new content on the internet (netflix, twitch ...). Hence it would be interesting to study what entertainment genres had an increase in popularity during the lockdown and if these new found hobbies stayed relevant in the eyes of the people even after the lockdown.

# Research Questions

How did the entertainment means change during the CoronaVirus pandemic lockdown compared to before? Did the genres, consumption levels and nature of entertainment change? Were these changes only valid during the lockdown or did we witness a continuation in the new means of entertainments even after the end of the lockdown?
