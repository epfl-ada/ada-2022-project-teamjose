# Abstract
In March of 2020, the Covid-19 outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the World health Organization. Worldwide, people were then recommended or obliged to stay home in order to limit the spread of the virus. This unusual situation left people with limited options for social and work activity, causing many to turn to the Internet for work, education and entertainment. As explained in the "Sudden Attention Shifts on Wikipedia During the COVID-19 Crisis" paper, the volume and nature of Wikipedia article research was affected by the lockdown waves. Notable findings were that "the sharp decrease in human mobility induced by COVID-19-related non-pharmaceutical interventions has boosted the volume of information seeking on Wikipedia and has changed the nature of the information sought, even considering non-COVID-19-related articles". After mobility restrictions were lifted the volume of research returned to the baseline for most topics, but not all. Topics that experienced persistent increases are mostly related to entertainment/culture. We decided to dig deeper, to find whether isolation situation changed the nature of media consumption (i.e., video-game/movie/book genres), and if those changes are persistent with mobility restrictions.  

Has the CoronaVirus pandemic change the way people like to spend their free time?
The CoronaVirus pandemic had a huge impact on all our lives. While everyone was isolated at home, it was clear that people had to change their ways of life as most of our daily outdoor hobbies became forbidden or restricted. Indeed, some public places like gyms or nightclubs had to close their doors and gatherings were extremely limited, making team sports such as football almost impossible to play. Therefore, the people had to find new ways to entertain themselves alone at home such as playing new video games or watching new content on the internet (netflix, twitch ...). Hence it would be interesting to study what entertainment genres had an increase in popularity during the lockdown and if these new found hobbies stayed relevant in the eyes of the people even after the lockdown.

# Research Questions

How did the entertainment means change during the CoronaVirus pandemic lockdown compared to before? Did the genres, consumption levels and nature of entertainment change? Were these changes only valid during the lockdown or did we witness a continuation in the new means of entertainments even after the end of the lockdown?


# Proposed additional datasets

* Mobile application downloads 2019-2021
* Google trends
* Wikipedia Api
* Wikidata
* Steam
* Twitch : Top games on Twitch 2016 - 2021, 
  In this dataset we can find the top 200 games on twitch for each month from 2016 to present day.
  The data is divided into two datasets:
    - A bigger file - Twitchgamedata in which we find 200 obeservations per month representing the top games or categories on twitch for that month.
    - A smaller file - Twitchglobaldata in which there is one obeservation per month that contains the general statistics about viewership on twitch.
